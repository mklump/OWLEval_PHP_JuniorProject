lcbell44 says:<br>
Well you just overwrote my work. We need to incorporate our work into one html page.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
I was work working in a the test plans folder and attempting to update the main page for deliverable 5.1 if that okay<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
I know. I had just updated the same for my contribution. I will redo the main page and incorporate our D 5 page.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
K, all I added was the link for deleverable 5.1 to the main page, sorry about that here comes the main page contain the link<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
Thanks. I'll let you know when I am done and email it out to the group. I also have my presentation slides on the web site.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
k<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
np<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
Matt, I noticed that you did the Test Plan for the Augment Evaluation Web Page Module. I had done the same. Did you not get my email stating that I was doing it?<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
Just a sec..<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
I see your note that you sent out on Sunday regarding wanting to do the "Instructor modify and save questions Test Plan." Isn't that completely different from the "Augment Evaluation" Test Plan?<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
It is the same.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
I guess I'm failing to see how there the same then<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
What does the augmentation do?<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
What were you assigned?<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
I guess it was my understanding that "Augment Evaluation" added the addional questions that Administrator and or Faculty may use for adding questions to the standard set of questions. It is my understand that this is what I was assigned.<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
Same for me.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
Well then, how about we compare notes and see if we can consolidate to a single test plan?<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
No. We need to figure out what is not done and who will do it.<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
You there?<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
Yeah, I have to do my work for qwest at the same time as this<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
Ok. I will send out a message to the group to find out what we are going to do now. I don't know what Mike was supposed to do.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
Mike was said to working on the test cases for the database as well as the connection to the database.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
As far as I know<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
Thanks<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
np<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
Matt, I am going to change some files and folders to eliminate spaces in the names. I'll let you know when I am done.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
Okay, I'm logged out<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
OK, I have updated the site and will send out another email with the changes.<br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
thanks again larry<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
Sure.<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
PS. The application you use for html added a lot of extra code that makes manual editing with notepad difficult. It would be nice if we had more time at the beginning to get all these logistical things figured out to minimize the work. Please do not use spaces in the names of web files and folders. It makes the URLs look like hell and manual editing of the html more difficult. <br><br>

Matt Klump says:<br>
I have to sign out Larry, our databases final is tonight<br><br>

lcbell44 says:<br>
OK, bye<br><br>
